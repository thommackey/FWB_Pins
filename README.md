# FWB Pins

- Create a new Application in the [Discord developers portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Clone this repo to your local environment.
- Run ```pip install Discord```
- Create a channel in your Discord server for the bot to post pinned messages. Paste the channel ID into ```review_channel.txt```
- Choose a custom emoji you will use to Pin things in your discord. Paste the emoji ID into ```custom_emoji_id.txt```
- Paste your Discord bot token into ```key.txt``` - You'll get this from the developers portal. 
- Invite the bot to your server and give it permission to access all the channels you're pinning from, as well as the review channel where pinned messages will be posted.
- Run ```Python3 fwb_pins.py``` to start the bot

Once running, you will be able to pin messages with both the custom emoji you setup, as well as the native ðŸ“Œ emoji. The messages you pin will be reposted with their information in the review channel. Additionally, any messages with 15+ reactions, will be pinned automatically. This number can be changed in the ```fwb_pins.py``` file.
