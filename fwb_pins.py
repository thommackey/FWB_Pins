Planning: bot-command setting of which pins go where

Flow:
- Parse instructions of which pins go to which channel.
    - !pin :emoji: <channel> "registers" any messages with :emoji: reacts to be pinned to <channel>
    - <channel> should default to the chan where the command was issued.
- Store which pins go to which channel.
    - No reason why a specific emoji can't pipe stuff to >1 channel, so we'll have {emoji_id: {set,of,chan_ids}}.
    - A global dict is fine to start. I don't think we need a db or anything here. Persistence schmersistence.
- On react, check if the emoji is in the dict's keys.
- If it is, pin it to the channels specified for that emoji.

- Would need to support custom emoji as well as unicode emoji â€”Â not sure how hard that is.
- Would be useful to have a command to show the current global dict. 
- Would be ideal to limit these commands to specific user roles.

- Do we keep the "hot"/soft-pin 15+ feature?
    - Seems possible, but how do you determine output channel? 
    - Another bot command: !pin hot <15>?
    - If we're doing that, do we keep the "count" requirement, and just default it to 1? So the dict could be
    - {emoji: {(chan_id_1, trigger_emoji_threshold), (chan_id_2, trigger_emoji_threshold)}}â€¦
    - Maybe this means you'd be better off using the chan_ids as keys and their triggers+thresholds as vals? Nah because we want to look up based on the emoji not the channel, and we don't really care about having different thresholds per emoji (e.g. 2 pins or 5 smileys or whatever).
    - So we either handle the "hot" feature as a unique case, or ditch it. 
    - I'd rather ditch it as it's not really useful for looseunit.
    - Ergo: NO, we ditch the "hot" feature.
- Let's remove the "count" requirement, and enforce that 1 of a given emoji is sufficient to be pinned.
- How do we prevent dupes in this world? 
    - More complex, because you want to prevent double-pinning to the _same_ channel, while allowing pinning to multiple channels.
    - i.e. add the :pushpin: to push to one channel, then later add the :some_other_react: to push to a different channel, but not re-push to the first chan.
    - This feels annoying.

- Scenarios:
    - 1 emoji posting to 1 chan
    - 1 emoji posting to 2 different chans
    - 2 different emoji posting to the same chan
    - 2 different emoji posting to 2 independent chans
